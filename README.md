# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API



MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 

This Project walkthrough how  to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. We wil  use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

The seed data is created using Insomnia.
